HP:0000252	Microcephaly	Head circumference is measured from just above the glabella (the most prominent point on the frontal bone above the root of the nose) to the most posterior prominent point of the occipital bone using a tape measure. Some standard charts are organized by centiles, others by standard deviations. It is important to add an indication of how far below the normal standard the head circumference is if an accurate assessment of this can be made. Microcephaly is an absolute term. The term relative microcephaly can be used when the head size centile is less than the centile for height, for example, head size at the 3rd centile with height at the 75% for age and sex. On prenatal ultrasound, microcephaly is diagnosed if the head circumference or the biparietal diameter is more than three standard deviations below the mean.

HP:0034392	Joint contracture	To assess a joint contracture, the passive or active range of motion (ROM) of a joint with a contracture is assessed by moving the joint through its natural range with no active effort from the individual. The angular distance of the joint motion and the loss of ROM in a contracture is recorded through comparison with the contralateral joint or normative values. Conventionally, a joint contracture is named according to the joint involved and the direction opposite the lack of range. For example, inability to fully extend the knee is referred to as a knee flexion contracture, compared to inability to bend (flex) the knee, which is referred to as a knee extension contracture. Contractures in neuromuscular diseases develop due to intrinsic myotendinous structural changes and extrinsic factors. Known contributing extrinsic factors include decreased ability to actively move a limb through its full range of motion, immobility or static positioning for prolonged periods of time, and agonist antagonist muscle imbalance. Intrinsic muscle tissue alterations in dystrophic myopathies contribute to contracture formation. The most significant histologic changes are those of muscle fiber loss, abnormal residual dystrophic muscle fibers, segmental necrosis of muscle fibers, and increased amounts of adipose tissue, connective tissue, and fibrosis.	A limitation in the passive range of motion of the elbow resulting from loss of elasticity in the periarticular tissues owing to structural changes of non-bony tissues, such as muscles, tendons, ligaments, joint capsules or skin. A contracture prevents movement of the associated body part. [PMID:22938881, PMID:26247029, PMID:30928194]

HP:0001252	Hypotonia	Hypotonia can be caused by abnormalities of the central nervous system, any element of the motor unit (including the lower motoneuron), or both. Hypotonia is not a specific diagnosis, but can be observed in hundreds of genetic and other diseases. The first distinction to make when assessing a child with hypotonia is whether decreased muscle tone is a result of an abnormality of the central nervous system (CNS), peripheral neuromuscular system, or a combined abnormality involving both. Clinical findings suggestive of an abnormality of the CNS may include hyperreflexia, cognitive developmental delay, and seizures. In contrast, physical findings pointing towards a neuromuscular origin may include weakness, lack of antigravity movements, muscle atrophy, fasciculations, and/or diminished reflexes, most often in the context of normal cognitive function. The HPO term does not distinguish between these etiologies. Additional HPO terms should be used as required to describe associated features.	Hypotonia is an abnormally low muscle tone (the amount of tension or resistance to movement in a muscle). Even when relaxed, muscles have a continuous and passive partial contraction which provides some resistance to passive stretching. Hypotonia thus manifests as diminished resistance to passive stretching. Hypotonia is not the same as muscle weakness, although the two conditions can co-exist.

HP:0003422	Vertebral segmentation defect	The vertebral column derives from somites, transient paired segments of mesoderm that surround the neural tube in the early embryo.

Disruption of these processes can a cause of severe segmentation defects of the vetebrae. The frequency of segmentation defects of the vetebra has been estimated at 0.5 of 1000 births. The range of segmentation defects includes left-right uneven formation of somites that results in hemivertebrae or wedge vertebrae. Incomplete segmentation can result in fused segments such as block vertebrae. A failure of the process of resegmentation and migration of the sclerotomal compartment can result in a failure of midline fusion, such as butterlfy vertebrae.

HP:0011849	Abnormal bone ossification	All bones are formed by the replacement by osteocytes of mesenchyme-derived connective tissue. Intramembranous ossification refers to the direct replacement of primitive mesenchyme with bone, and is responsible for bones such as the calvarium (e.g., frontals, parietals, interparietal) and the clavicula. In endochondral ossification, the mesenchyme differentiates into a cartilaginous intermediate, which serves as a template (anlange) that is subsequently removed and replaced by bone. Most bones are formed via endochondral ossification, including those at the base of the skull, the vertebral column, pectoral and pelvic regions and long bones of the extremities. A reduction in the amount of mineralized bone compared with that expected for a given developmental age. In clinicakl parlance, reduced ossification and delayed ossification are often used synonymously, but in principle a bone delayed ossification in a child can display normal ossification at a later developmental stage. The HPO will therefore treat poor, reduced, and decreased officiation as synonymous, and delayed ossification as a specific kind of reduced ossification.	Any anomaly in the formation of bone or of a bony substance, or the conversion of fibrous tissue or of cartilage into bone or a bony substance. [https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0736-9199, PMID:18157903]

HP:0003908	Corner fracture of metaphysis	A corner fracture is a subepiphyseal planer fracture through immature metaphyseal bone. The appearance of a corner, avulsion or bucket handle depends on the extent of bone failure and radiographic projection. Bone can fail in this pattern from both shearing and tensile stresses. The weakest area of bone for a given loading condition determines the injury threshold for that structure.	Fracture or fragmentation at the lateral portion of the metaphysis of a long bone. The radiographic appearance is that of a small corner of metaphysis separated from the metaphyseal edge by thin linear radiolucency. This feature can be observed in child abuse but fragmented appearance of the metaphysis or facture-like lesions can also be detected in the setting of certain skeletal dysplasias.

HP:0005743	Avascular necrosis of the capital femoral epiphysis	In medical parlance, this is often referred to as Legg Calve Perthes disease. Here, the name 'Avascular necrosis of the capital femoral epiphysis' is preferred to emphasize that the term refers to a phenotypic feature rather than a disease entity. Avascular necrosis of the femoral head may result in pain in the hip, limp, stiffness and reduced range of motion, and some degree of atrophy of the affected leg. The phrase Legg Perthes syndrome or Legg Calve Perthes disease is also used to refer to a number of diseases, including the idiopathic form and a form that is related to mutation in the COL2A1 gene (MIM 150600). Legg-Calve-Perthes disease usually occurs in boys 4 to 10 years old, and is clinically characterized by limping, hip stiffness, limited range of motion, and can result in restriction of growth of the affected leg and wasting of the muscles of the upper thigh.	Avascular necrosis of the proximal epiphysis of the femur occurring in growing children and caused by an interruption of the blood supply to the head of the femur close to the hip joint. The necrosis is characteristically associated with flattening of the femoral head, for which reason the term coxa plana has been used to refer to this feature in the medical literature.

HP:0000677	Oligodontia	The diagnosis of oligodontia requires a radiograph, as is true for anodontia and for the other designation of tooth agenesis, hypodontia. The terms hypodontia and oligodontia are sometimes used interchangeably in the literature while on other occasions hypodontia is used for selective agenesis of six or less missing teeth while oligodontia is applied when there are more than six missing teeth. Tooth agenesis or oligodontia/hypodontia can be mistaken for delayed eruption and again a radiograph is needed for diagnosis. Absence of teeth may be congenital (tooth agenesis) or acquired. The incidence of congenital absence of teeth is different depending on the type and position of the tooth [Gorlin et al, 2001].

HP:0000219	Thin upper lip vermilion	Normal values for the height of the vermilion are available [Farkas, 1981], but measurements are not commonly used. Most clinicians determine this feature subjectively or use the Likert scale for Caucasians and African Americans [Astley and Clarren, 2000]. The height of the vermilion of the upper lip varies among ethnic groups, and the vermilion should be compared to a population of same ethnic background. The thinness of the upper lip vermilion is sensitive to facial expression. On profile view, a thin vermilion is less convex than usual. A thin upper lip vermilion may be associated with a smooth philtrum and an absence of the Cupid's bow, but these should be assessed separately.	Height of the vermilion of the upper lip in the midline more than 2 SD below the mean. Alternatively, an apparently reduced height of the vermilion of the upper lip in the frontal view (subjective).

HP:0002748	Rickets		Rickets is divided into two major categories including calcipenic and phosphopenic. Hypophosphatemia is described as a common manifestation of both categories. Hypophosphatemic rickets is the most common type of rickets that is characterized by low levels of serum phosphate, resistance to ultraviolet radiation or vitamin D intake. There are several issues involved in hypophosphatemic rickets such as calcium, vitamin D, phosphorus deficiencies. Moreover, other disorder can be associated with its occurrence such as absorption defects due to pancreatic, intestinal, gastric, and renal disorders and hepatobiliary disease. Symptoms are usually seen in childhood and can be varied in severity. Severe forms may be linked to bowing of the legs, poor bone growth, and short stature as well as joint and bone pain. Hypophosphatemic rickets are associated with renal excretion of phosphate, hypophosphatemia, and mineral defects in bones. The familial type of the disease is the most common type of rickets.

The febrile response (of which fever is a component) is a complex physiologic reaction to disease, involving a cytokine-mediated rise in core temperature, generation of acute phase reactants, and activation of numerous physiologic, endocrinologic, and immunologic systems. The rise in temperature during fever is to be distinguished from that occurring during episodes of hyperthermia. Unlike fever, hyperthermia involves an unregulated rise in body temperature in which pyrogenic cytokines are not directly involved and against which standard antipyretics are ineffective. It represents a failure of thermoregulatory homeostasis, in which there is uncontrolled heat production, inadequate heat dissipation, or defective hypothalamic thermoregulation.

HP:0032011	Heterophoria	In contrast to heterophoria, heterotropias are manifest deviations. Some individuals may be phoric in one situation (e.g. for distance) and tropic in another (e.g. for near). The distinction between heterotropia and heterophoria is that heterotropia refers to a misalignment of the eyes when the affected individual is looking at an object while the eyes are uncovered whereas heterophoria is a misalignment that is observed only when the two eyes are no longer looking at the same object. The monocular cover-uncover test is the most important test for detecting the presence of manifest strabismus and for differentiating a heterophoria from a heterotropia.	Heterophorias are latent deviations that are controlled by fusion. In certain circumstances (specific visual tasks, fatigue, illness, etc.), fusion can no longer be maintained and decompensation occurs. []

HP:0004942	Aortic aneurysm	Aneurysm is considered a severe (pathological) form of dilatation of a segment of a blood vessel. In clinical practice, dilatation and aneurysm are occasionally used interchangably. In this subhierarchy, we therefore use aneurysm as the primary label and list dilatation as a broad synonym.	Aortic dilatation refers to a dimension that is greater than the 95th percentile for the normal person age, sex and body size. In contrast, an aneurysm is defined as a localized dilation of the aorta that is more than 150 percent of predicted (ratio of observed to expected diameter 1.5 or more). Aneurysm should be distinguished from ectasia, which represents a diffuse dilation of the aorta less than 50 percent of normal aorta diameter. []

HP:0000453	Choanal atresia		Absence or abnormal closure of the choana (the posterior nasal aperture). Most embryologists believe that posterior choanal atresia results from a failure of rupture between the 35th and 38th day of fetal life of the partition which separates the bucconasal or buccopharyngeal membranes. The resultant choanal atresia may be unilateral or bilateral, bony or membranous, complete or incomplete. In over 90 per cent of cases the obstruction is bony, while in the remainder it is membranous. The bony type of atresia is commonly located 1-2 mm. anterior to the posterior edge of the hard palate, and the osseous septum varies in thickness from 1 to 10 mm.

HP:0002515	Waddling gait		Weakness of the hip girdle and upper thigh muscles, for instance in myopathies, leads to an instability of the pelvis on standing and walking. If the muscles extending the hip joint are affected, the posture in that joint becomes flexed and lumbar lordosis increases. The patients usually have difficulties standing up from a sitting position. Due to weakness in the gluteus medius muscle, the hip on the side of the swinging leg drops with each step (referred to as Trendelenburg sign). The gait appears waddling. The patients frequently attempt to counteract the dropping of the hip on the swinging side by bending the trunk towards the side which is in the stance phase (in the German language literature this is referred to as Duchenne sign). Similar gait patterns can be caused by orthopedic conditions when the origin and the insertion site of the gluteus medius muscle are closer to each other than normal, for instance due to a posttraumatic elevation of the trochanter or pseudarthrosis of the femoral neck.

HP:0100242	Sarcoma	A sarcoma (from the Greek sarx meaning flesh) is a general term describing a malignant neoplasm, or cancer, that arises from transformed connective tissue cells such as bone, cartilage and fat cells, which originate from embryonic mesoderm. This is in contrast to carcinomas, which are of epithelial origin (breast, colon, pancreas, and others). However, due to an evolving understanding of tissue origin, the term sarcoma is sometimes applied to tumors now known to arise from epithelial tissue. The term soft tissue sarcoma is used to describe tumors of soft tissue, which includes elements that are in connective tissue, but not derived from it (such as muscles and blood vessels).	A connective tissue neoplasm formed by proliferation of mesodermal cells. Bone and soft tissue sarcomas are the main types of sarcoma. Sarcoma is usually highly malignant.

HP:0001680	Coarctation of aorta	Coarctation refers to a narrowing of the lumen of a vessel producing an obstruction to flow. Coarctation can occur in any region of the aorta. Coarctation of the aorta is often a discrete obstruction commonly located in the descending thoracic aorta. More specifically, it is usually located in the juxtaductal position immediately distal to the left-subclavian artery in a left-sided arch. The hallmark clinical finding in coarctation of the aorta is hypertension proximal to the lesion, with diminished blood pressure distal to the obstruction. Consequently, clinical diagnosis can be made by the presence of diminished lower extremity pulses, differences in timing between upper extremity central pulses (often brachial) and lower extremity central pulses (often femoral), or the presence of a supine arm-leg blood pressure gradient.	Coarctation of the aorta is a narrowing or constriction of a segment of the aorta. [https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0736-9199, PMID:23909637]
HP:0001642	Pulmonic stenosis	Pulmonic stenosis is often seen as a part of Fallot' s tetralogy, in which case the events leading to the formation of the overriding aorta are also believed to be a cause of the pulmonic stenosis. The pulmonic stenosis is the major cause of the malformations seen in patients with Fallot tetralogy, with the other associated malformations acting as compensatory mechanisms to the pulmonic stenosis. The degree of stenosis varies between individuals with TOF, and is the primary determinant of symptoms and severity.	A narrowing of the right ventricular outflow tract that can occur at the pulmonary valve (valvular stenosis), below the pulmonary valve (infundibular stenosis), or above the pulmonary valve (supravalvar stenosis).

Supernumerary teeth are most frequent in the upper maxilla, and typically, a single additional tooth is present. We discourage the use of distodens, distomolars (an extra fourth molar posterior to the third molar), paramolars (supernumerary tooth in the molar region) but rather to mention the presence of the supernumerary tooth mesial to or distal to a tooth from the normal series. Diagnosing a supernumerary tooth may require radiographic examination. A supernumerary tooth present between the maxillary central incisors is called mesiodens.

The presence of an aortic valve with two instead of the normal three cusps (flaps). Bicuspid aortic valvue is a malformation of a commissure (small space between the attachment of each cusp to the aortic wall) and the adjacent parts of the two corresponding cusps forming a raphe (the fused area of the two underdeveloped cusps turning into a malformed commissure between both cusps; the raphe is a fibrous ridge that extends from the commissure to the free edge of the two underdeveloped, conjoint cusps).

HP:0010780	Hyperacusis	Hyperacusis refers to a general hypersensitivity to sound of any frequency, and phonophobia to an anxious sensitivity towards specific sound largely independent of its volume. Hyperacusis and phonophobia represent disturbances of central auditory processing without peripheral pathology, often combined with psychosomatic reactions. Listeners with hearing loss often struggle to detect low-level sounds, but as the sound intensity rises above threshold, loudness initially grows at a faster than normal rate, but the growth rate slows with increasing intensity so that normal loudness is achieved at high intensities. This phenomenon is referred to as loudness recruitment. However, in some hearing-impaired listeners,loudness continues to grow more rapidly than normal at suprathreshold intensities causing moderately intense sounds to be perceived as louder than normal, a debilitating condition known as hyperacusis or loudness intolerance.	Over-sensitivity to certain frequency ranges of sound. [PMID:14645606, PMID:14647932, PMID:31669363]

HP:0033379	Bilateral superior vena cava	The thoracic embryonic venous system is composed of two large veins (the superior cardinal veins) which return blood from cranial aspect of embryo, and the inferior cardinal vein, which returns blood from the caudal aspect. Both pairs of veins join to form right and left common cardinal veins before entering the embryological heart. The left common cardinal vein persists to form coronary sinus and oblique vein of left atrium. During the 8th week of gestation, an anastomosis forms between right and left superior cardinal veins resulting in the innominate (or brachiocephalic) vein. The cephalic portion of superior cardinal veins form the internal jugular veins. The caudal portion of right superior vein forms the normal right-sided superior vena cava, while the portion of the left superior cardinal vein caudal to the innominate vein normally regresses to become the ligament of Marshall. If this normal regression of the left superior cardinal vein fails to occur, a persistent left-sided vascular structure that empties into the coronary sinus, results (Persistent left superior vena cava or PLSVC). The innominate vein may or may not degenerate in these cases leading to variations in anatomy. The most common subtype of PLSVC results in the presence of both left and right SVCs (Bilateral SVC). A bridging innominate vein may or may not be present.	The presence of a left and a right superior vena cava. [PMID:18847480]

HP:0000011	Neurogenic bladder	Neurogenic bladder sphincter dysfunction (NBSD) can develop as a result of a lesion at any level in the nervous system, including the cerebral cortex, spinal cord, or peripheral nervous system. Neurologic conditions in children leading to neurogenic bladder dysfunction are predominantly congenital neural tube defects (including myelomeningocele, lipomeningocele, sacral agenesis, and occult lesions causing tethered cord). Acquired causes such as spinal cord tumors or trauma or sequelae of transverse myelitis are less frequent. Whereas from an etiologic standpoint neurogenic bladder dysfunction is a heterogeneous group, medical management will be similar irrespective of the underlying cause.	A type of bladder dysfunction caused by neurologic damage. Neurogenic bladder can be flaccid or spastic. Common manifestatios of neurogenic bladder are overflow incontinence, frequency, urgency, urge incontinence, and retention. [https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0736-9199, PMID:18095004, PMID:22400020]

HP:0000039	Epispadias	Epispadias may be present in a phenotypic male, female, or an individual with ambiguous genitalia. A meatus in a phenotypic male may be positioned either on the glans (glandular or balanic epispadias), the shaft (penile epispadias) or at the attachment of the penis to the abdominal wall (penopubic epispadias). Alternatively, the urethra may be an open groove along the dorsal shaft of the penis, with no readily recognized meatus. Epispadias is a frequent component of Bladder exstrophy, but should be coded separately.	Epispadias is a urogenital malformation characterized by the failure of the urethral tube to tubularize on the dorsal aspect. Unlike in hypospadias, where the meatus is on the ventral aspect, children with epispadias have a wide-open urethral plate on the dorsum. It is commonly seen as a component in the spectrum of bladder exstrophy-epispadias-complex. Isolated epispadias constitutes less than 10 percent of the total cases of epispadias.

HP:0000268	Dolichocephaly	Cephalic index is the ratio of head width expressed as a percentage of head length. The normal range is 76-80.9%. Head length is measured between the glabella (the most prominent point on the frontal bone above the root of the nose) and the most prominent part of the occiput in the midline, using spreading calipers. Head width is measured between the most lateral points of the parietal bones on each side of the head, using spreading calipers. Cephalic index standards are derived from Caucasians and have limited relevance for other races and ethnicities. Current norms have limited validity because of changes in infant sleeping position and consequent changes in head shape. New data should be developed. Dolichocephaly is distinct from Prominent occiput, but both can be present in the same individual and should be coded separately. Scaphocephaly is a subtype of dolichocephaly where the anterior and posterior aspects of the cranial vault are pointed (boat-shaped).	An abnormality of skull shape characterized by a increased anterior-posterior diameter, i.e., an increased antero-posterior dimension of the skull. Cephalic index less than 76%. Alternatively, an apparently increased antero-posterior length of the head compared to width. Often due to premature closure of the sagittal suture.

HP:0002133	Status epilepticus	In 2015 the ILAE Task Force on Classification of Status Epilepticus concluded that the evidence to define time points 1 and 2 in humans was incomplete. For tonic-clonic status epilepticus t1 is defined as 5 minutes and t2 as 30 minutes. For focal status epilepticus with impaired consciousness t1 is defined as 10 minutes and t2 over 60 minutes. For absence status epilepticus t1 is defined as 10-15 minutes and t2 is unknown.	Status epilepticus is a type of prolonged seizure resulting either from the failure of the mechanisms responsible for seizure termination or from the initiation of mechanisms which lead to abnormally prolonged seizures (after time point t1). It is a condition that can have long-term consequences (after time point t2), including neuronal death, neuronal injury, and alteration of neuronal networks, depending on the type and duration of seizures.

HP:0040223	Pulmonary hemorrhage		Pulmonary hemorrhage is a bleeding within the lungs. Older children and adults may spit blood or bloody sputum. Neonates, infants and young children usually do not spit up blood. Anemia, pulmonary infiltrates, increasingling bloody return on BAL and the presence of hemosiderin-laden macrophages in broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) fluid or lung biopsy can diagnose lung bleeding. Alveolar macrophages contain phagocytosed red blood cells and stain positive for hemosiderin, a product of hemoglobin degradation, after about 48-72 hours following pulmonary hemorraghe. Previous or recurrent bleeding can thus be distinguished from fresh events. A differentiation into local or diffuse is of importance.

Centrilobular refers to a location that is central within secondary pulmonary lobules. []
HP:0025179	Ground-glass opacification	Ground-glass opacification is a non-specific sign and can be observed with many conditions including infection, chronic interstitial disease and acute alveolar disease. See Figure 2 of Hansell DM, et al., Fleischner Society: glossary of terms for thoracic imaging. Radiology. 2008;246:697-722.	On chest radiographs, ground-glass opacity appears as an area of hazy increased lung opacity, usually extensive, within which\nmargins of pulmonary vessels may be indistinct. On CT scans, it appears as hazy increased opacity of lung, with preservation of bronchial and vascular margins. It is caused by partial filling of airspaces, interstitial thickening (due to fluid, cells, and/or fibrosis), partial collapse of alveoli, increased capillary blood volume, or a combination of these, the common factor being the partial displacement of air. Ground-glass opacity is less opaque than consolidation, in which bronchovascular margins are obscured. [PMID:18195376, PMID:23247773]

HP:0002349	Focal aware seizure	In the previous (1981) ILAE classification of seizure types, the term 'simple partial seizure' was used to denote a focal aware seizure. Awareness during a seizure is defined as the patient being fully aware of themself and their environment throughout the seizure, even if immobile. If awareness is preserved throughout, then the seizure is a focal aware seizure. Previously the terms simple partial was used to describe focal aware seizures.	A type of focal-onset seizure in which awareness is preserved. Awareness during a seizure is defined as the patient being fully aware of themself and their environment throughout the seizure, even if immobile.

HP:0010818	Generalized tonic seizure	Characterized by a sudden increase in muscle tone whereby the body, arms, or legs make sudden stiffening movements and consciousness is usually preserved. Tonic seizures can occur during sleep. Tonic seizures usually affect both sides of the body, and cause a fall if the affected person was standing when the seizure started.	A generalized tonic seizure is a type of generalized motor seizure characterised by bilateral limb stiffening or elevation, often with neck stiffening without a subsequent clonic phase. The tonic activity can be a sustained abnormal posture, either in extension or flexion, sometimes accompanied by tremor of the extremities.

HP:0004303	Abnormal muscle fiber morphology	Normal human muscle is composed of many individual muscle fibers bundled together by layers of connective tissue that are arranged in a nesting-doll like fashion. The inner most structure, the single muscle fiber, is covered by a thin layer of primarily reticular fibers called the endomysium. The endomysium is quite inconspicuous and muscle fibers appear to be in direct contact with each other. The finest capillaries, nerve twigs and lymphatic capillaries are found within the endomysium. Groups of muscle fibers are bound together by the thicker perimysium, forming structures called fascicles. Capillaries, nerve fibers and lymphatic vessels also track in the perimyseum. Bundles of fascicles are encased within the dense irregular connective tissue of the epimysium. These connective tissue layers provide mechanical protection for the muscle fibers and increase the tensile strength of the muscle. The layers are continuous with the tendon, which provides attachment to bone. Individual muscle fibers are syncytia, formed by embryonic fusion of many myoblasts or later, myosatellite cells. Each muscle fiber contains many nuclei, peripherally positioned immediately adjacent to the sarcolemmal membrane. In healthy muscle only 3-5 percent of fibers contain nuclei that are located internally, within the cell, but many disease processes lead to internal nuclei. Each nucleus provides a segment of the cell with needed translated protein products.	Any abnormality of the skeletal muscle cell. Muscle fibers are subdivided into two types. Type I fibers are fatigue-resistant and rich in oxidative enzymes (they stain light with the myosin ATPase reaction), and type II fibers are fast-contracting, fatigue-prone, and rich in glycolytic enzymes (these fibers stain darkly). Normal muscle tissue has a random distribution of type I and type II fibers. [https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0736-9199, PMID:22938878]

HP:0100033	Tics	Tics can be invisible to the observer, such as abdominal tensing or toe crunching. Common motor and phonic tics are, respectively, eye blinking and throat clearing. Movements of other movement disorders (for example, chorea, dystonia, myoclonus) must be distinguished from tics. Other conditions, such as autism and stereotypic movement disorder, also include movements which may be confused with tics. Tics must also be distinguished from the compulsions of OCD and from seizure activity. Tics may increase as a result of stress, fatigue, boredom, or high-energy emotions, which can include negative emotions, such as anxiety, but positive emotions as well, such as excitement or anticipation. Relaxation may result in a tic increase (for instance, watching television or using a computer), while concentration on an absorbing activity often leads to a decrease in tics.

HP:0100704	Cerebral visual impairment	The term cortical/cerebral visual impairment (CVI) was coined to describe damage to visual pathways and structures occurring during early perinatal development. The term cortical visual impairment was originally proposed to describe visual dysfunction in pediatric populations of non-ocular cause, and its presumed association with damage to early visual cortical areas. However, as further characterization of this condition progressed, it became evident that CVI was often associated with damage to sites beyond early visual cortex including subcortical structures, white matter pathways, as well as higher-order associative processing areas of the cortex. Thus, the word cortical has been viewed as somewhat of a misnomer, and there has been the suggestion that the term cerebral would be a more encompassing and appropriate term. Although there is still a debate in the community about the most appropriate nomenclature, the HPO will regard these terms as synonymous. It is recommended that more specific terms be used as appropriate for annotation.	A form of loss of vision caused by damage to the visual cortex rather than a defect in the eye.

Signs range from very focal findings, such as nystagmus, eye flutter, blinking, and eye deviation to more widespread signs, such as myoclonus, tremulousness, and autonomic instability.	A condition in which epileptiform abnormalities are believed to contribute to the progressive disturbance in cerebral function. Epileptic encephalaopathy is characterized by (1) electrographic EEG paroxysmal activity that is often aggressive, (2) seizures that are usually multiform and intractable, (3) cognitive, behavioral and neurological deficits that may be relentless, and (4) sometimes early death.

HP:0000533	Chorioretinal atrophy	Choroidal sclerosis is a descriptive term applied to the ophthalmoscopic appearance of prominent white choroidal vessels in which the blood columns are not seen or are sheathed by white lines. Choroidal sclerosis is a term used to describe a group of genetically heterogeneous retinal dystrophies that share a common funduscopic phenotype of scalloped, well-circumscribed, and confluent chorioretinal atrophic lesions that extend beyond the macula. The term choroidal sclerosis was initially coined because of the sclerotic appearance of choroidal vessels which frequently appear white or light-yellow. However, histologic studies have demonstrated the term to be a misnomer as the principle abnormality is the loss of choriocapillaris, retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), and the outer retina in the absence of abnormal sclerotic changes in the choroidal vasculature. Therefore, we are making choroidal sclerosis a synonym of chorioretinal atrophy.	Atrophy of the choroid and retinal layers of the fundus. [https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0736-9199, PMID:20224472]

HP:0001397	Hepatic steatosis	Although steatosis is the hallmark of the fatty liver disease, it is not a specific feature because it can be seen as part of other disease processes, such as drug injury, Wilson disease, or hepatitis C virus infection (especially genotype-3). Involvement of less than 5% of the hepatocytes by steatosis is considered clinically insignificant and within reference range. Based on the morphologic appearance and the size of the lipid droplets within the cytoplasm of the hepatocytes, steatosis is characterized as macrovesicular or microvesicular. Macrovesicular steatosis is characterized by large lipid droplets occupying the cytoplasm, displacing the nucleus to the periphery (large droplet macrovesicular steatosis) or multiple small lipid droplets of variable size occupying the cytoplasm with the nucleus maintaining its central location (small droplet macrovesicular steatosis). Microvesicular steatosis is characterized by innumerable tiny, relatively uniform lipid vacuoles that result in a bubbly appearance of the hepatocytes.	Steatosis is a term used to denote lipid accumulation within hepatocytes. [https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0736-9199, PMID:31603713]

HP:0001942	Metabolic acidosis	The Henderson-Hasselbalch method defines metabolic acidosis by the presence of an acid-base imbalance associated with a plasma bicarbonate concentration below 20 mmol/L. The association of this imbalance with decreased pH is called acidemia, which is often described as severe when the pH is equal to or below 7.20. Arterial blood gas measurements can be performed in patients with a decreased plasma bicarbonate level so as to eliminate respiratory alkalosis, confirm the diagnosis of metabolic acidosis, and test for mixed acidosis.	Metabolic acidosis (MA) is characterized by a fall in blood pH due to a reduction of serum bicarbonate concentration. This can occur as a result of either the accumulation of acids (high anion gap MA) or the loss of bicarbonate from the gastrointestinal tract or the kidney (hyperchloremic MA). By definition, MA is not due to a respirary cause. [https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0736-9199, PMID:17936961, PMID:31418093]

HP:0010307	Stridor	Stridor is different from wheezing by the following reasons. It is louder over the neck than chest wall. Secondly; stridor is mainly inspiratory. If occurs in expiration, it is usually biphasic. On the other hand; wheeze is mainly expiratory and occurs during both phases. It indicates extrathoracic upper-airway obstruction (supraglottic lesions like laryngomalacia, vocal cord lesion) when heard on inspiration. It occurs in expiration if associated with intrathoracic tracheobronchial lesions (tracheomalacia, bronchomalacia, and extrinsic compression). It occurs in both phases if lesion is fixed, for example, stenosis. Stridor is caused by the turbulent flow passing through a narrowed segment of the upper respiratory tract.	Stridor is a high pitched sound resulting from turbulent air flow in the upper airway. [https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0736-9199, PMID:26229557]

If the muscle tone in the adductors is marked, the resulting gait disorder is referred to as scissor gait. [PMID:27770207]
HP:0012407	Scissor gait	Scissor gait is a form of gait abnormality primarily associated with spastic cerebral palsy.	A type of spastic paraparetic gait in which the muscle tone in the adductors is marked. It is characterized by hypertonia and flexion in the legs, hips and pelvis accompanied by extreme adduction leading to the knees and thighs hitting, or sometimes even crossing, in a scissors-like movement. The opposing muscles (abductors) become comparatively weak from lack of use. [https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0736-9199]

HP:0002172	Postural instability		A tendency to fall or the inability to keep oneself from falling; imbalance. The retropulsion test is widely regarded as the gold standard to evaluate postural instability, Use of the retropulsion test includes a rapid balance perturbation in the backward direction, and the number of balance correcting steps (or total absence thereof) is used to rate the degree of postural instability. Healthy subjects correct such perturbations with either one or two large steps, or without taking any steps, hinging rapidly at the hips while swinging the arms forward as a counterweight. In patients with balance impairment, balance correcting steps are often too small, forcing patients to take more than two steps. Taking three or more steps is generally considered to be abnormal, and taking more than five steps is regarded as being clearly abnormal. Markedly affected patients continue to step backward without ever regaining their balance and must be caught by the examiner (this would be called true retropulsion). Even more severely affected patients fail to correct entirely, and fall backward like a pushed toy soldier, without taking any corrective steps. [PMID:25613349]

HP:0012817	Noncompaction cardiomyopathy	Noncompaction of the ventricular myocardium is a cardiomyopathy thought to be caused by arrest of normal embryogenesis of the endocardium and myocardium. This abnormality is often associated with other congenital cardiac defects, but it is also seen in the absence of other cardiac anomalies. During early embryonic development, the myocardium is a loose network of interwoven fibers separated by deep recesses that link the myocardium with the left ventricular cavity. Gradual compaction of this spongy meshwork of fibers and intertrabecular recesses, or sinusoids, occurs between weeks 5 and 8 of embryonic life, proceeding from the epicardium to endocardium and from the base of the heart to the apex. Noncompaction of the ventricular myocardium (NVM) is an uncommon finding. It is thought to be caused by arrest of the normal process of endomyocardial morphogenesis. The left ventricle is uniformly affected, but biventricular noncompaction has been reported, with right ventricular noncompaction described in less than one-half of patients. Because of difficulty in distinguishing normal variants in the highly trabeculated right ventricle from the pathological noncompacted ventricle, several authors dispute the existence of right ventricular noncompaction [PMID:15210614].	A type of cardiomyopathy characterized anatomically by deep trabeculations in the ventricular wall, which define recesses communicating with the main ventricular chamber.

HP:0011147	Typical absence seizure	In 2017 the ILAE Commission for Classification and Terminology recommended classifying a seizure as having focal or generalized onset only when there is a high degree of confidence (>80%, arbitrarily chosen to parallel the usual allowable beta error) in the accuracy of this determination; see Dialeptic seizure. Typical absences have 2 essential components: (1) clinically the impairment of consciousness (absence), and (2) EEG generalized 3 Hz to 4 Hz (less than 2.5 Hz) spike and slow wave discharges.	A typical absence seizure is a type of generalised non-motor (absence) seizure characterised by its sudden onset, interruption of ongoing activities, a blank stare, possibly a brief upward deviation of the eyes. Usually the patient will be unresponsive when spoken to. Duration is a few seconds to half a minute with very rapid recovery. Although not always available, an EEG would usually show 3 Hz generalized epileptiform discharges during the event.

HP:0008151	Prolonged prothrombin time	The prothrombin time (PT) and the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) are the most requested tests to investigate patients with congenital or acquired coagulopathies and drug monitoring. They are defined as the time (seconds) needed to clot platelet-poor plasma upon addition of coagulation triggers, such as tissue factor in complex with phospholipids and calcium chloride (in the PT), or negatively charged phospholipids-activators and calcium chloride (in the APTT). They can hence be considered as global coagulation tests sensitive to deficiencies of many coagulation factors. In brief, they are both sensitive to factor X, V, II and fibrinogen, whereas the PT is only sensitive to factor VII deficiency and the APTT is sensitive to pre-kallikrein, high molecular weight kininogen (HMWK), factor XII, XI, IX and VIII deficiencies. Normal plasma in the PT clots approximately within 10-12 s upon triggering coagulation, and the normal reference range is (usually) narrow. PT results have been reported as clotting time, percentage activity, PT-ratio (patient-to-normal clotting time) and as international normalized ratio (INR). The INR scale has been devised to harmonize results stemming from different thromboplastins from patients on treatment with vitamin K antagonists. Some recommend abandoning the approach of using percentage activity to assess PR.	Increased time to coagulation in the prothrombin time test, which is a measure of the extrinsic pathway of coagulation. The results of the prothrombin time test are often expressed in terms of the International normalized ratio (INR), which is calculated as a ratio of the patient's prothrombin time (PT) to a control PT standardized for the potency of the thromboplastin reagent developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) using the formula: INR is equal to Patient PT divided by Control PT.

HP:0002181	Cerebral edema	Cerebral edema refers to swelling within brain tissue due to the accumulation of fluid, and can occur as in response to almost any insulting agent. Edema canbe observed in and around regions of dead or dying brain, around metastases and abscesses, after traumatic injury, following hypoxic ischemic injury, and around primary brain tumors. There are at least five different types of edema: vasogenic, cytotoxic, hydrostatic, interstitial, and hypoosmotic. Three effects of edema are visible on imaging: (i) loss of gray-white matter differentiation; (ii) swelling of sulci (shrinking of gyri); and (iii) mass effects. On CT scanning, extensive low density may represent vasogenic edema. As the brain swells, not only do the sulci decrease, but all of the CSF spaces of the hemispheres (including the ventricles) decrease as well. Magnetic resonance tomography may show abnormalities of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and Fluid attenuation inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences. Phenotype terms involving cerebral edema thus reflect inference about the underlying processes responsible for these abnormalities on brain imaging.	Abnormal accumulation of fluid in the brain.

HP:0001985	Hypoketotic hypoglycemia	Normally, decreased glucose production leads to increased mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation and the production of ketones. Thus, ketones provide an indication of whether the hypoglycemia is a result of inadequate production or overutilization of glucose (which tends to be associated with low plasma ketone levels). Hypoketotic hypoglycemia developing within several minutes of feeding is typical of hyperinsulinism. A good starting point for evaluating hypoglycemia is to divide patients into ketotic or non-ketotic. Normal physiologic response to decreased glucose production is increased mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation and the production of ketones. Ketones provide an indirect indication of whether hypoglycemia is the result of inadequate production or of over-utilization of glucose (insulin-induced over-utilization, associated with low urine or plasma ketones). The history of the relationship of the hypoglycemia to feeding is often helpful. Hypoketotic hypoglycemia developing within several minutes of feeding is typical of hyperinsulinism. Patients with defects in glycogen breakdown, gluconeogenesis, or fatty acid oxidation tend to tolerate short-term fasting much better.

HP:0031396	Abnormal proportion of naive T cells	Following the development of T cells in the thymus, they enter the blood stream and recirculate between the blood and peripheral lymphatic tissues. Mature recirculating T cells that have not yet encountered their specific antigen are known as naive T cells. Mature T cell not yet exposed to antigen with the phenotype CCR7-positive, CD45RA-positive, and CD127-positive. This cell type is also described as being CD25-negative, CD62L-high and CD44-low. Human mature CD4+ T cells are functionally heterogeneous and can be divided into naive and memory/effector populations based on the expression of cell surface markers. Although the most significant differences between these two populations are functional, the leukocyte common Ag (CD45) was promoted as a potential marker of memory T cells. CD45 Ag may be found in various isoforms depending on alternative splicing of three extracellularly expressed exons. The expression of the highest molecular weight isoform, referred to as CD45RA, defines the population of CD4+ unprimed lymphocytes. Activation of naive lymphocytes through TCR engagement is followed by loss of CD45RA Ag and transition to the expression of the smallest molecular weight isoform CD45RO. These primed cells express high levels of activation Ags, acquire effector functions, and need less costimuli requirements for further activation.	Any abnormality in the proportion of naive T cells relative to the total number of T cells. [PMID:12133935]

HP:0030799	Scaphocephaly	Dolichocephaly is a term in wide use to describe any long narrow head, with a cephalic index usually below 75%. Scaphocephaly, derived from the Greek skaphe (a light boat or skiff), describes a specific variety of a long narrow head that resembles an inverted\nboat with a keel. Scaphocephaly thus refers to an inverted keellike appearance to the skull, with the widest part of the skull in the temporal rather than parietal area and with palpable ridging over part or all of the sagittal suture (PMID:16156241).	Scaphocephaly is a subtype of dolichocephaly where the anterior and posterior aspects of the cranial vault are pointed (boat-shaped). Scaphocephaly is caused by a precocious fusion of sagittal suture without other associated synostosis. [https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0736-9199, PMID:16156241, PMID:23960302]

HP:0025405	Visual fixation instability	Eye movements are made several times a second to place and hold images of objects of interest onto the central part of the retina, the fovea, where visual acuity is best. These eye movements fall into two main classes. Saccades are fast and brief movements, reaching peak speeds of hundreds of degrees per second and lasting only tens of milliseconds that quickly shift new visual images to the fovea. Smooth pursuit eye movements are slow and continuous, steadily rotating the eyes to track any motion of the visual target, minimizing the retinal slip and the resulting blur that might otherwise reduce spatial acuity. Between these movements, the eyes are held relatively still. These periods of steady fixation are the result of a dynamic process that appears to be actively controlled by many of the same brain structures involved in the generation of goal-directed eye movements.

HP:0001917	Renal amyloidosis	In the kidney, amyloid deposits may be found in any of the parenchymal compartments, including glomeruli, tubules, interstitium and/or vessels. Glomeruli are most commonly involved. In most instances, amyloid accumulation involves the mesangium before the capillary walls. In early cases, the process can be subtle and involves only a few mesangial regions and therefore can easily be missed by routine histologic evaluation. More extensive involvement results in marked expansion of the mesangium, which can take on a nodular appearance and mimic mesangial sclerotic processes such as diabetic glomerulosclerosis. However, the often negative staining with PAS and JMS is more typical of amyloid.	A form of amyloidosis that affects the kidney. On hematoxylin and eosin stain, amyloid is identified as extracellular amorphous material that is lightly eosinophilic. These deposits often stain weakly for periodic acid Schiff (PAS), demonstrate a blue-to-gray hue on the trichrome stain and are typically negative on the Jones methenamine silver (JMS) stain. These tinctorial properties contrast with the histologic appearance of collagen, a major component of basement membranes, mesangial matrix and areas of sclerosis, which demonstrates strong positivity for PAS and JMS (See Figure 1 of PMID:25852856).

HP:0032107	Limbal stem cell deficiency	The corneal epithelium covers the corneal surface and plays a major role in protection and transparency. Epithelial cells are shed regularly and replaced by stem cell sources located at the limbus, a rim of tissue located at the junction of the cornea and sclera. The limbal epithelial stem cells reside in specific regions at the limbus known as the limbal stem cell niches. Damage to the stem cells or disruption of the niches may lead to Limbal Stem Cell Deficiency. In the absence of a healthy corneal epithelium, the conjunctiva proliferates over the cornea resulting in opacification and vascularization, which in turn may lead to reduced vision, pain, and photophobia.	A condition characterized by a loss or deficiency of the stem cells in the limbus that are vital for re-population of the corneal epithelium and to the barrier function of the limbus.

However, in conditions that produce electrical uncoupling, these M cells have significant effects on repolarisation producing prolonged rounded ST-T waves or U waves. The finding of U wave inversion on an ECG at rest or baseline is a non-specific finding. It is significant when observed post exercise, being originally described in early 1940s. Subsequent studies in the late 1970s, demonstrated a significant correlation of U wave inversion with either left main or LAD disease.	An anomaly of the U wave of the electrocardiogram (EKG). The U wave is a small (0.5 mm) deflection immediately following the T wave, usually in the same direction as the T wave. It is best seen in leads V2 and V3. [PMID:22665396]
HP:0005184	Prolonged QTc interval		A longer than normal interval (corrected for heart rate) between the Q and T waves in the heart's cycle.

HP:0006682	Premature ventricular contraction	A premature ventricular contraction may be perceived as a skipped beat or as palpitations. Although they may cause symptoms such as palpitations or dizziness, incidental PVCs are generally considered benign. Highly frequent PVCs, however, can have detrimental effects on the left ventricular function over time and may cause or worsen heart failure.	Premature ventricular contractions (PVC) or ventricular extrasystoles are premature contractions of the heart that arise in response to an impulse in the ventricles rather than the normal impulse from the sinoatrial (SA) node.

HP:0004756	Ventricular tachycardia	Ventricular tachycardia (VT) is a potentially life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia that presents as a wide QRS complex tachycardia, and is defined as three or more consecutive QRS complexes with a duration longer than 120 milliseconds (ms) and a rate of 100 beats per minute or more, whereby the complexes have a ventricular origin. VT can be subdivided as follows: (i) sustained VT persists for 30 seconds or more; (ii) non-sustained VT lasts less than 30 seconds; (iii) monomorphic VT displays a uniform QRS morphology; and (iv) polymorphic VT displays QRS morphologies that variy from beat to beat. VT is observed most commonly in individuals with structural heart disease or acute myocardial infarction (MI). VT may also be observed in in the setting of drug toxicity or electrolyte abnormalities or in individuals with Mendelian disease.	A tachycardia originating in the ventricles characterized by rapid heart rate (over 100 beats per minute) and broad QRS complexes (over 120 ms). []

HP:0200040	Epidermoid cyst	A cyst is a cavity containing liquid, semisolid, or solid material. An epidermoid cyst is a benign cyst that develops out of ectodermal tissue and consists of a thin layer of squamous epithelium. An epidermal cyst may or may not be painful or release pus, and are usually noticed as a bump on the skin. Epidermal cysts and trichilemmal cysts are clinically indistinguishable. The wall of the epidermal cyst conserves the epidermal layers, but the wall of the trichilemmal cysts, which arise from the external root sheath, shows palisading of unlayered epithelial cells. Homogeneous horny material that is further degraded to fat and cholesterol forms within both types of cysts.	Nontender, round and firm, but slightly compressible, intradermal or subcutaneous cyst measuring 0.5-5 cm in diameter. Epidermal cysts are intradermal or subcutaneous tumors, grow slowly and occur on the face, neck, back and scrotum. They usually appear at or around puberty, and as a rule an affected individual has one solitary or a few cysts. [https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5316-1399]

HP:0010289	Cleft maxillary alveolar ridge	The palate develops from the frontonasal and maxillary prominences between 4 and 12 weeks of gestation. During gestational weeks 4 to 7, the primary palate originates from the median palatine process, which itself originated from frontonasal prominence. The lip, alveolus, and hard palate anterior to the incisive foramen all share this origin in development. During this period, disruptions of palatal development process can result in primary palate clefting. The secondary palate develops from the lateral palatine processes originating from the maxillary prominences between 7 and 12 weeks, and the hard palate posterior to incisive foramen and the soft palate are developmental products of this process. As such, disruptions during this time will result in secondary palate clefts. The alveolus is a component of the primary palate, and alveolar cleft results from mal-development of the frontonasal prominence. As such, it is most closely related to cleft lip and cleft palate. Generally, alveolar clefts are located between the lateral incisor and canine.	A gap (cleft) affecting one of the alveolar ridges, which are the protuberances in the mouth that contain the sockets (alveoli) of the teeth. An alveolar cleft can affect all structures of the alveolar ridge, including the gingiva, other mucosa, periosteum, alveolar bone, and teeth. Alveolar cleft occurs in response to divergence from normal development during frontonasal prominence growth, contact, and fusion. The most common alveolar portion of the cleft is located between the lateral incisor and the canine. [HPO_CONTRIBUTOR:mengelstad, https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0736-9199]

HP:0030984	Abnormal serum bile acid concentration	There are two major bile acids, cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid, which are synthesised in the hepatocyte by the cytochrome P450-mediated oxidation of cholesterol. These bile acids are secreted into the biliary canaliculi as sodium salts and conjugated with glycine, taurine, sulphate or glucuronic acid, and stored in the gall bladder until excreted into the intestinal lumen in response to a fatty meal. Enterohepatic circulation of bile salts is associated with conversion of the primary bile salts to seconday bile salts by bacerial enyzmes. The total bile pool of about 4 grams is recirculated about 5 to 10 times per day. Because serum bile salt concentration can increase by two to five times after a meal it is important that bile salts are measured while the subject is fasting.

HP:0032252	Granuloma	Granulomas vary considerably in their degree of complexity, physical size and organization. Not surprisingly, their classification has attracted much attention, and a numbers of schemes have been described. The cornerstone of the granulomatous response, however, is the predominant involvement of mononuclear phagocytes. As granulomas develop, tissue-resident, as well as inflammatory mononuclear phagocytes become intimately acquainted, and these cells may develop highly differentiated epithelioid cell characteristics. In many cases, elegant multinucleate populations can be seen, distinct from the syncytia formed after viral infection as evident by their extended life-span. Accumulating lymphocytes, mainly T cells, contribute to the developing microarchitecture of the granuloma, often with characteristic patterns of subset organization relative to the core of mononuclear phagocytes and to each other. B lymphocytes, plasma cells, NK cells and neutrophils may all be present, though a relative paucity of neutrophils delineates these sites of inflammation from those associated with necrosis. At its extreme, the granuloma may serve as the focus for irreversible fibrotic reactions, but, even in less dramatic cases, a substantive degree of local tissue remodelling occurs.

HP:0002635	Type IV atherosclerotic lesion		In type IV atherosclerotic lesions a dense accumulation of extracellular lipid occupies an extensive but well-defined region of the intima. This type of extracellular lipid accumulation is known as the lipid core. A fibrous tissue increase is not a feature, and complications such as defects of the lesion surface and thrombosis are not present. The type IV lesion is also known as atheroma. Type IV is the first lesion considered advanced in this classification because of the severe intimal disorganization caused by the lipid core. The characteristic core appears to develop from an increase and the consequent confluence of the small isolated pools of extracellular lipid that characterize type III lesions. The increase in lipid is believed to result from continued insudation from the plasma. Type IV lesions, when they first appear in younger people, are found in the same locations as adaptive intimal thickenings of the eccentric type. Thus, atheroma is, at least initially, an eccentric lesion. [PMID:7648691]

HP:0005576	Tubulointerstitial fibrosis	This finding is usually shown by renal biopsy. Fibrosis involves an excess accumulation of extracellular matrix and usually results in loss of function when normal tissue is replaced with scar tissue. Tubulointerstitial renal fibrosis, characterized as a progressive detrimental connective tissue deposition on the kidney parenchyma, appears to be a harmful process leading inevitably to renal function deterioration, independently of the primary renal disease which causes the original kidney injury. Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) of tubular epithelial cells which are transformed to mesenchymal fibroblasts migrating to adjacent interstitial parenchyma constitutes the principal mechanism of renal fibrosis along with local and circulating cells. (PMID:20011086)	A progressive detrimental connective tissue deposition (fibrosis) on the kidney parenchyma involving the tubules and interstitial tissue of the kidney. Tubulointerstitial injury in the kidney is complex, involving a number of independent and overlapping cellular and molecular pathways, with renal interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy (IF/TA) as the final common pathway. However, IF and TA are separable, as shown by the profound TA in renal artery stenosis, which characteristically has little or no fibrosis (or inflammation). For new annotations it is preferable to annotate to the specific HPO terms for Renal interstitial lfibrosis and/or Renal tubular atrophy.

HP:0040148	Cortical myoclonus		Cortical myoclonus mainly affects the distal upper limbs and face, which reflects the largest cortical representations of these body areas. It is often focal, but may be multifocal, bilateral or generalized, as a consequence of intracortical and transcallosal spreading of abnormal activity. It typically occurs on voluntary action and may affect speech and gait. Cortical myoclonic jerks are stimulus sensitive, typically to touch, but sensitivity to visual stimuli is also described. Most patients with cortical myoclonus have both positive myoclonus and NM, occurring either independently or together as a complex of the two kinds of myoclonus. If cortical myoclonus is prolonged and lasts for hours, days or weeks, it is called epilepsia partials continua and is considered to be a rare form of focal epileptic status. Focal cortical myoclonus almost always points to an underlining lesion of the sensori-motor cortex, which produces hyperexcitability (e.g. vascular, inflammatory or neoplastic). [PMID:21339907]

HP:0100256	Senile plaques	Senile plaques can be found in human and animal brains. From an age of 60 years (10%) to an age of 80 years (60%) the proportion of people with plaques increases approximately linearly. A small number of plaques can be due to the physiological process of aging. Women are slightly more likely to have plaques than males. The plaques occur commonly in the amygdoid nucleus and the sulci of the cortex of brain. The deposits are associated with degenerative neural structures and an abundance of microglia and astrocytes. Large numbers of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are characteristic features of Alzheimers disease, and some of the abnormal neurites in senile plaques are composed primarily of paired helical filaments, a component of neurofibrillary tangles. In Alzheimer's disease they are primarily composed of amyloid beta peptides. These polypeptides tend to aggregate and are believed to be neurotoxic.

HP:0100524	Limb duplication		Congenital duplication of all or part of a limb. []
HP:0010689	Mirror image polydactyly	Transplantation of the ZPA (zone of polarised activity) to the anterior margin of a limb bud in the chick results in mirror image duplication of limb elements (Tabin, 1991). Similarly, mirror image duplication in the forelimb of the mouse has been observed with ectopic expression of Hox b-8 (Charit6 et al, 1994). Mirror hand anomaly in humans has been shown to be due to either aberrant positioning of the ZPA or altered inductive interactions of the Shh gene resulting in impairment of the mechanism responsible for the organization and differentiation of the limb bud, rather than a primary duplication event. In other words, the primary event results in failure of the radial ray to develop. The ulnar area will then induce the differentiation of two groups of ulnar rays. Timing of this insult could play a critical role in severity of this phenotypic feature. Syndromal mirror hand is probably due to agene mutation of the Shh gene (Hersh et al, 1995). Finally, the multiple hand deformity may be explained by true duplication of the ZPA.	A hand or foot with more than five digits that has a recognizable A/P axis of symmetry. The axis can lie within a normally formed or partially duplicated digit resembling a middle finger, index finger, thumb, toe, or hallux. Alternatively, the axis can be in an interdigital space with a flanking pair of digits that resemble a middle finger, index finger, thumb, toe or hallux. The most lateral digits on each side of the hand/foot typically resemble fifth fingers/toes. [https://orcid.org/0009-0006-4530-3154, PMID:19125433]

Over 120 different fragile sites have been identified in the human genome. Some of these sites are sensitive to folate, that is, they can be induced by a culture medium deficient in folic acid and thymidine, and hence a medium with lowered levels of dTTP or dCTP, two immediate components of DNA, or by a medium enriched either in methotrexate, an inhibitor of folate metabolism, or in fluorodeoxyuridine, an inhibitor of thymidylate synthesis. The folate-dependent fragile phenotype occurs if more than a critical number of CCG/CGG repeats are present (e.g., > 230 repeats for FRAXA).

HP:0005521	Disseminated intravascular coagulation	DIC is a complex syndrome in which there is pathological generation of thrombin and diffuse intravascular clot formation. DIC may occur as acute decompensated or chronic compensated form. In acute decompensated DIC, there is a sudden massive exposure of tissue factor over a brief time period; Intravascular coagulation can also compromise the blood supply to organs and, in conjunction with hemodynamic and metabolic derangements, may contribute to the failure of multiple organs. At the same time, the use and subsequent depletion of platelets and coagulation proteins resulting from the ongoing coagulation may induce severe bleeding. Chronic DIC, also known as compensated DIC, results from a persistent weak or intermittent activating stimulus. Under such conditions, destruction and production of coagulation factors and platelets are balanced.	Disseminated intravascular coagulation is characterized by the widespread activation of coagulation, which results in the intravascular formation of fibrin and ultimately thrombotic occlusion of small and midsize vessels.

It is often accompanied by exacerabtion or new onset of exhaustion, cognitive impairment, muscle pain, muscle weakness, or other manifestations. The onset of PEM may occur hours or even days after exertion, and recovery from PEM is often slow, taking place over days or weeks or longer. PESE can contribute to the episodic nature of disability in post COVID-19 condition, often presenting as unpredictable fluctuations in symptoms and function.	Post-exertional symptom exacerbation (PESE), also referred to as post-exertional malaise (PEM), is defined as the worsening of symptoms that can follow minimal cognitive, physical, emotional, or social activity, or activity that could previously be tolerated. Symptoms typically worsen 12 to 72 hours after activity and can last for days or even weeks, sometimes leading to a relapse. [PMID:25695122, PMID:26904705, PMID:32105793, PMID:33071931]

HP:0031901	Elevated total serum tryptase	Tryptase is a serine protease that is primarily produced and stored in mast cells (MCs) and less abundantly in blood basophils [31-34]. In tissue MCs, tryptase is produced and released in a constitutive manner, regardless of the organ, location of MCs, maturation stage or subtype of MCs. Mature tissue MCs also store larger quantities of the enzyme in their metachromatic granules. Two major forms of tryptase are produced in MCs, alpha-tryptase and beta-tryptase. Whereas the alpha form is produced and released constantly in MCs, the beta-form is primarily stored in MC granules. During an anaphylactic reaction, MCs rapidly release substantial amounts of alpha- and beta tryptases. Current tests measure total tryptase (alpha and beta), not differentiating between these isoforms. The presence of elevated tryptase may occur acutely due to mast cell degranulation. Alternatively, chronic elevation of basal serum tryptase may be present in individuals with: 1) clonal myeloid neoplasms; 2) the genetic trait hereditary alpha-tryptasemia; 3) chronic kidney disease. Serum tryptase levels are useful in the diagnosis of mast cell activation, clonal myeloid disease, and hereditary alpha-tryptasemia.	An abnormally elevated concentration of total tryptase (alpha and beta tryptase) in the blood circulation. [PMID:16372800, PMID:19522836, PMID:25169217, PMID:27749843, PMID:3295549]

In wound repair, neovascularization (NV) involves the sprouting of new vessels from pre-existent vessels to repair or replace damaged vessels. In the retina, NV is a response to ischemia. The NV adheres to the inner surface of the retina and outer surface of the vitreous. NV are deficient in tight junctions and hence leak plasma into surrounding tissue including the vitreous. Plasma causes the vitreous gel to degenerate, contract, and eventually collapse which pulls on the retina. Since retinal NV is adherent to both retina and vitreous, as the vitreous contracts the NV may be sheared resulting in vitreous hemorrhage or the NV may remain intact and pull the retina with the vitreous resulting in retinal elevation referred to as traction retinal detachment.

The pathophysiology of secondary hyperparathyroidism results from abnormalities in the renal tubular absorption of phosphate with reduced phosphate excretion and hyperphosphatemia, as well as impaired renal conversion of 25-hydroxycholecalciferal to 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol, which in turn leads to a decrease in the intestinal absorption of calcium. In combination, elevated serum phosphate levels and reduced vitamin D production result in decreases in serum calcium levels or hypocalcemia, leading to hyperparathyroidism.	Secondary hyperparathyroidism refers to the production of higher than normal levels of parathyroid hormone in the presence of hypocalcemia. [https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0736-9199, PMID:19836494]

HP:0025196	Increased total iron binding capacity	Iron is transported to body tissues by a protein, transferrin, in plasma. This protein has two high-affinity binding sites for iron. Determination of total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) of the plasma therefore gives a measure of transferrin, although it can also be directly determined. Virtually all plasma iron (P1) normally is bound to transferrin, and measurement of P1 is assumed to reflect the amount of transferrin iron. The expression transferrin saturation, expressed as percent [(P1/TIBC) x 100], indicates the availability of iron to tissues. As transferrin saturation increases, there is an increase in the amount of diferric transferrin, which has a greater capacity to deliver iron than does monoferric transferrin. Measurements of P1, TIBC, and transferrin saturation have served several purposes in clinical medicine. The P1 concentration and (particularly) transferrin saturation relect the adequacy of iron supply. A saturation of less than 16% indicates a deficient iron supply, whereas a saturation of over 60% as measured on more than one occasion represents excessive iron loading owing to increased iron absorption or liver disease. An increased transferrmn concentration as reflected in the TIBC indicates iron depletion if the effects of estrogen and pregnancyare excluded. Other characteristic changes inboth P1 and TIBC are useful in the differential diagnosis of various diseases, for example, the decrease in transferrin saturations associated with a decreased transferrin concentration in inflammatory states.	An elevation in the total-iron binding capacity, which measures how much serum iron is bound if an excess of radioactive iron is added. A high TIBC corresponds to a high transferrin concentration. The latent (or free) iron binding capacity is the difference between the TIBC and the measured serum iron, corresponding to the transferrin not bound to iron, i.e., free iron binding capacity.

HP:0033687	Short term memory impairment	The impairment of short term memory (STM) involves forgetting information to which the subject has been recently exposed. An individual with signs of losing STM, indeed, asks for the same questions repeatedly, forgets where he just put something, forgets recent events or something he saw or read recently. The loss of immediate memory is also termed as fixation amnesia. Practically, STM works as a kind of scratchpad for temporary recall of a limited number of data that come from the sensory register and are ready to be processed through attention and recognition. On the other side, information collected in the long term memory (LTM) storage consist of memories for the performance of actions or skills (i.e., procedural memories, knowing how) and memories of facts, rules, concepts, and events (i.e., declarative memories, knowing that).

The most common presentation is with ascites, but can range from fulminant hepatic failure (FHF) to asymptomatic forms. Obstruction of hepatic venous outflow is mainly caused by primary intravascular thrombosis, which can occur suddenly or be repeated over time, accompanied by some revascularization, accounting for the variable parenchymal hepatic damage and histologic presentation. Budd-Chiari syndrome is thus a disease, but since it occurs as a manifestation of several other diseases, this term is kept for the present for convenience.

HP:0008330	Reduced von Willebrand factor activity	Von Willebrand factor (VWF) is a key hemostatic protein, but documenting its function through laboratory tests is not always straightforward. VWF serves as a carrier protein for factor VIII (FVIII), and also facilitates platelet adhesion through its interaction with platelet GPIb on the platelet surface and through its binding to the subendothelial matrix. This interaction is driven in vivo by shear stress, which induces a conformational change in VWF that allows it to bind platelet GPIb. In vitro, however, this interaction is induced by the antibiotic ristocetin, which enables VWF and platelet GPIb to interact in the absence of shear forces. Laboratory testing of VWF utilizes ristocetin in the VWF ristocetin cofactor activity assay (VWF:RCo), which is a measure of VWF binding to platelets, or by ristocetin-induced platelet aggregation (RIPA).	Decreased activity of von Willebrand factor. Von Willebrand factor mediates the adhesion of platelets to the collagen exposed on endothelial cell surfaces.

TREC analysis provides a very specific assessment of T-cell recovery (eg, after hematopoietic cell transplantation) or numerical T-cell competence	Reduced level of T cell receptor excision circle (TRECs) as measured by the TREC assay. Late in maturation, 70% of thymocytes that will ultimately express alpha/beta-T cell receptors form a circular DNA TREC from the excised TCRdelta gene that lies within the TCRalpha genetic locus. The circles are stable but do not increase following cell division and, therefore, become diluted as T cells proliferate. A quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) reaction across the joint of the circular DNA provides the TREC copy number, a marker of newly-formed, antigenically-naïve thymic emigrant T cells.

HP:0100665	Angioedema	Apart from the common form, mediated by allergy, it has been reported as a side effect of some medications, in particular ACE inhibitors. Additionally, there are three autosomal dominant inherited forms known, due to mutations in the genes that control the clotting cascade, including the SERPING1 gene, which results in deficiency of the blood protein C1-inhibitor (type I HAE) and the F12 gene, which controls Factor XII (type III HAE). There is an additional type in which C1 levels are normal but C1 function is decreased (type II HAE). All three forms are called hereditary angioedema (HAE) or occasionally by the outdated term 'hereditary angioneurotic edema' (HANE). In all forms of HAE, swelling may also occur in the digestive tract and other organs. It is life-threatening when it involves the larynx due to the potential for asphyxiation.	Rapid swelling (edema) of the dermis, subcutaneous tissue, mucosa and submucosal tissues of the skin of the face, normally around the mouth, and the mucosa of the mouth and/or throat, as well as the tongue during a period of minutes to several hours. The swelling can also occur elsewhere, typically in the hands. Angioedema is similar to urticaria, but the swelling is subcutaneous rather than on the epidermis.

HP:0006454	Delayed patellar ossification	The patella initially ossifies at between three and five years, commencing as multiple foci that rapidly coalesce. As the patellar ossification center enlarges the expanding margins may be irregular and associated with accessory ossification centers.

The patella expands to all cartilaginous contours during late adolescence when the epiphyseal ossification centers around the knee are also in the final stages of maturation. The only cartilage not replaced is that occupying the superior two-thirds of the articular surface (the lower one-third is covered by the fat pad). The subchondral plate does not assume the actual articular contours until the late stages of osseous maturation (after ten to twelve years).

HP:0025175	Honeycomb lung	Pathologically, honeycombing is manifested as small air-containing cystic spaces that are lined by bronchiolar epithelium and have thickened walls of dense fibrous tissue. On high-resolution CT, honeycombing presents with a characteristic cystic appearance. The cystic spaces range from 3 mm to 1 cm in diameter, although they can be larger. The cystic spaces are characterized by well delineated walls 1 to 3 mm in thickness. The cysts are air-filled and appear lucent in comparison to normal lung parenchyma. Honeycombing is a manifestation of end-stage lung fibrosis.	Honeycombing represents destroyed and fibrotic lung tissue containing numerous cystic airspaces with thick fibrous walls, representing the late stage of various lung diseases, with complete loss of acinar architecture. The cysts range in size from a few millimeters to several centimeters in diameter, have variable wall thickness, and are lined by metaplastic bronchiolar epithelium. On chest radiographs, honeycombing appears as closely approximated ring shadows, typically 3-10 mm in diameter with walls 1-3 mm in thickness, that resemble a honeycomb; the finding implies end-stage lung disease. On CT scans, the appearance is of clustered cystic air spaces, typically of comparable diameters on the order of 3-10 mm but occasionally as large as 2.5 cm. Honeycombing is usually subpleural and is characterized by well-defined walls. It is a CT feature of established pulmonary fibrosis. Because honeycombing is often considered specific for pulmonary fibrosis and is an important criterion in the diagnosis of usual interstitial pneumonia, the term should be used with care, as it may directly impact patient care.

HP:0025197	Inclusion body fibromatosis		A benign tumor made up of mostly myofibroblasts that appears almost exclusively on the digits of the hands and feet, rarely involving the thumb or big toe. The lesion displays a proliferation of bland intradermal spindle cells arranged in whorls, fascicles, or a storiform pattern in a collagenous background of varying degrees. Also usually present are perpendicular tumor cell fascicles that extend to the epidermis. The small intracytoplasmic inclusions are said to appear similar to red blood cells. The inclusion bodies have been shown to be made up of densely packed vimentin and actin filaments. The tumor often causes a dome-shaped elevation of the overlying structures, forming a protuberant or polypoid nodule. The overlying epidermis can display a host of changes, including acanthosis, hyperkeratosis, parakeratosis, rete ridge flattening, entrapment of adnexal structures, and, rarely, ulceration.

HP:0032308	Increased circulating procalcitonin concentration	Procalcitonin is a 116 amino acid peptide that has an approximate MW of 14.5 kDa and belongs to the calcitonin (CT) superfamily of peptides. It can be divided into 3 sections including the amino terminus of the PCT region, immature calcitonin, and calcitonin carboxyl-terminus peptide-1 (CCP-1). Procalcitonin is encoded by CALC-1 gene located on chromosome 11. Cleavage in 1 site of the primary transcript of CALC-1 gene produces pre-PCT, which further undergoes proteolytic cleavage of its signal sequence to produce PCT. The synthesized PCT then undergoes post-translational processing to produce small peptides and mature CT. PCT is a biomarker that exhibits greater specificity than other proinflammatory markers (eg, cytokines) in identifying patients with sepsis and can be used in the diagnosis of bacterial infections. The short half-life (25-30 hours in plasma) of PCT, coupled with its virtual absence in health and specificity for bacterial infections, gives it a clear advantage over the other markers of bacterial infection.

HP:0012746	Thin toenail	No objective standard for nail thickness could be identified. An unsupported claim suggests that nails are 0.5 mm in females and 0.6 mm in males (http://www.emedicine.com/orthoped/topic421.htm). Thin nails are usually brittle, may easily fray, or break at the free edge. Thin nails usually grow slowly but this definition does not require slow growth of the nail. Note that the term koilonychia is an abnormal shape of the fingernail where the nail has raised ridges and is thin and concave. Since it include other characteristics besides thin nails, it should not be used to indicate this. The affected digits should be specified.	Toenail that appears thin when viewed on end.

HP:0011575	Imperforate tricuspid valve	Imperforate valve is distinct from atretic valve. The hallmark of an imperforate valve is that it provides potential communication between an atrium and a ventricle. It exists as fused valve leaflets usually possessing their own hypoplastic tensor apparatus. The presence of an imperforate valve may have important surgical implications. Imperforate valve is in contrast to atretic valve with an absent atrioventricular connection. The cornerstone of the diagnosis of an imperformate valve is the identification of a thin mobile membrane between an atrium and a ventrile and the recognition of the tensor apparatus of the valve. In most cases the tensor apparatusis hypoplastic and it maynot be possible to delineate it by echocardiography.	A tricuspid valve that has failed to open. [HPO_CONTRIBUTOR:DDD_dbrown, PMID:7066117]

HP:0001071	Angiokeratoma corporis diffusum	Angiokeratoma corporis diffusum (ACD) commonly occurs in Fabry disease and the term ACD was previously used synonymously with Fabry disease (OMIM:301500). However, ACD can also occur with other diseases related to deficiencies of enzymes that are involved in the metabolism of glycoproteins, including fucosidosis, sialidosis, mannosidosis, GM1 gangliosidosis, and Kanzaki disease.	Angiokeratoma corporis diffusum (ACD) is typically characterized by innumerable small red to black papules which occur in clusters and are situated symmetrically in the bathing trunks area. The number of lesions and the extension of the body increase steadily with time so that generalization and mucosal involvement are common. The single lesion begins with a minute reddish papule which enlarges to up to 10 mm in diameter, becomes dark red to black with a discrete keratotic overgrowth. Histologically, the papules are characterized by superficial dilated capillaries in papillary dermis with epidermal proliferation. []
